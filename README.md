# btnetnew
Re-skin btnet with bootstrap ui

*I started this project for myself then decided to share it. All css conversions changed by me.*

**Database scripts** are in **setup directory**.

There are settigs in **web.config** file. I already opened tasks and html editor.

**Default username/password** is admin.

After conversion I didn't check all pages for functionality. **It needs testing** for permissions and functions.
